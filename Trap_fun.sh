#In Bash scripting, there is no built-in "try-catch" mechanism like in some other programming languages. However, you can achieve similar error #handling behavior by utilizing the trap command and defining custom error handling functions.
#!/bin/bash

# Define the error handling function
handle_error() {
  echo "An error occurred!"
  # Additional error handling logic can be added here
}

# Set the trap to invoke the error handling function on any error
trap 'handle_error' ERR

# Example: Division by zero
dividend=10
divisor=0

result=$((dividend / divisor))
echo "Result: $result"

# The script continues execution after the error handling
echo "Script execution completed."
